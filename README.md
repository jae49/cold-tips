# cold-tips
A collection of tips and tricks for software development

These tips and tricks are lessons (sometimes hard-learned) about how to solve
situations and problems encountered during software development whether it's
building and compiling source code into libraries and executables or trying
to fix an issue with a third-party library that seems to have few solutions.

## Build Systems

### [Gradle](build-systems/gradle/README.md)
Though the Kotlin syntax dcoumentation for Gradle has greatly improved recently,
Gradle can still have surprising ways of accomplishing certain build patterns.
The examples here all use Kotlin syntax.

## Software Libraries and APIs

### [Kotlin Libraries and APIs](libraries/kotlin/README.md)
Since Kotlin has a certain level of compatibility with Java, the tips and
tricks here can be used in Java in most cases; however, the tips and tricks
will be shown using Kotlin syntax which may require some work to use in Java

## [Web Techniques](web-techniques/README.md)
Less common techniques for implementing functionality with web sites.
